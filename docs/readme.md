# Yello — Project Reference

Living reference for features, integrations, and architecture decisions. See `docs/log.md` for the change-by-change history and `docs/database.md` for the schema overview.

## Configuration

### Environment variables (frontend build)

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_PUBLIC_URL` | Absolute public origin of the deployed app (e.g. `https://yello.example.com`, no trailing slash needed). Baked into the `og:image` / `twitter:image` meta tags at build time — the Open Graph spec requires absolute image URLs, and link scrapers (iMessage, Slack, Facebook, LinkedIn) ignore relative ones. When unset, the tags fall back to root-relative paths: fine for dev, but shared links won't render a preview image. |

Vite build-time variables must be present when `npm run build` runs. On Railway (Docker build), set `VITE_PUBLIC_URL` as a service variable — the `Dockerfile` declares it as an `ARG` in the frontend build stage so it reaches Vite. If the domain changes, update the variable and redeploy, then force a re-scrape in each platform's debugger (e.g. Facebook Sharing Debugger) since scrapers cache previews.
